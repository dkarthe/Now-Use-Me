Apple made Portrait effect a mainstream feature last year with the launch of the iPhone 7 Plus. This year with the iPhone 8 Plus (and the iPhone X), Apple is taking things to the next level with a feature it calls Portrait Lighting.

As the name suggests, this feature lets you play around with the lighting effects when clicking a portrait photo. Apple claims it spent countless hours perfecting this feature by studying portraits by renaissance masters. The feature is currently in beta mode. Hereâ€™s a guide to what Portrait Lighting is all about, and how you could use it.

Portrait Lighting presets
There are four presets in the Portrait Lighting feature, and these include Studio Light, Contour Light, Stage Light, and Stage Light Mono. The first preset brightens up the face to remove any harsh shadows. Contour Light, as the name suggests, adds dramatic shadows to a portrait. Stage light puts the spotlight on the subject, making it stand out against a black background. Stage Light Mono is same preset, but converts the photo to black and white.

How to use Portrait Lighting
Using the Portrait Lighting feature is pretty straightforward. It is a part of the native camera app. Tap on the Portrait option in the app, and you will see a small 3D cube above the shutter button. Sliding to the left will move you from preset-to-preset.

Apple also allows you to add Portrait Lighting effect after a photo has been clicked. If you have clicked a portrait in normal setting, you can head over to the Photos app to edit it. Open the photo, and in the top-right corner hit the edit button. Once in edit mode, you will see the same preset options that are available in the camera app. The overall result however is not on par with when clicking a photo with a particular portrait effect in real-time.
